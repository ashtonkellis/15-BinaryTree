## To Submit this Assignment
* Create a pull request from your `lab-15` branch to your master branch
* Submit on canvas 
a question: is it customary for something like this to declare a separate Node class? or shoudl i build this functionality inside of my BinaryTree class?
and observation: recursion is much less intimidating that i originally thought
your original estimate: 2 hours

#### Feature Tasks  
 * Implement an **in-order** traversal function that returns a string of the visited node's values.
      * For example : `6,8,7,9,2,1,4,3,5`
   
 #### Testing
* write at least one test assertion for each method of the Binary Tree Data Structure
   
####  Documentation
Otherwise, please explain how a user should execute your code and run your tests if someone else were to clone down this repo. Please include Big Oh time complexity for traversal of your binary tree.
